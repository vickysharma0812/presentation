  abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods (DGFEM) offer
              certain advantages over standard continuous finite element methods
              when applied to the spatial discretisation of the acoustic wave
              equation. For instance, the mass matrix has a block diagonal
              structure which, used in conjunction with an explicit time stepping
              scheme, gives an extremely economical scheme for time domain
              simulation. This feature is ubiquitous and extends to other
              time-dependent wave problems such as Maxwell's equations. An
              important consideration in computational wave propagation is the
              dispersive and dissipative properties of the discretisation scheme
              in comparison with those of the original system. We investigate
              these properties for two popular DGFEM schemes: the interior
              penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method applied to the
              second-order wave equation and a more general family of schemes
              applied to the corresponding first order system. We show how the
              analysis of the multi-dimensional case may be reduced to
              consideration of one-dimensional problems. We derive the dispersion
              error for various schemes and conjecture on the generalisation to
              higher order approximation in space},

              finite-difference solutions and solutions obtained by the more
              classical analytical approaches. This problem is studied by means
              of a comparison of seismograms computed for receivers located in
              the vicinity of a 90-degree wedge embedded in an infinite
              two-dimensional acoustic medium. The calculations were carried out
              both by the finite-difference method and by a more conventional
              eigenfunction expansion technique. The results indicate the
              solutions are in good agreement provided that the grid interval for
              the finite-difference method is sufficiently small. If the grid is
              too coarse, the signals computed by the finite-difference method
              become strongly dispersed, and agreement between the two methods
              rapidly deteriorates. This effect, known as ``grid dispersion,''
              must be taken into account in order to avoid erroneous
              interpretation of seismograms obtained by finite-difference
              techniques. Both second-order accuracy and fourth-order accuracy
              finite-difference algorithms are considered. For the second-order
              scheme, a good rule of thumb is that the ratio of the upper
              half-power wavelength of the source to the grid interval should be
              of the order of ten or more. For the fourth-order scheme, it is
              found that the grid can be twice as coarse (five or more grid
              points per upper half-power wavelength) and good results are still
              obtained. Analytical predictions of the effect of grid dispersion
              are presented; these seem to be in agreement with the experimental

              for r {$\leq$}100, and this means that the time-coupled
              computations within a time step can actually be decoupled. By using
              either continuous Galerkin or spectral element methods in space, we
              apply this DG-in-time methodology, for the first time, to
              second-order wave equations including elastodynamics with and
              without Kelvin--Voigt and Maxwell--Zener viscoelasticity. An
              example set of numerical results is given to demonstrate the
              favourable effect on error and computational work of the moderately
              high-order (up to degree 7) temporal and spatio-temporal
              approximations, and we also touch on an application of this method
              to an ambitious problem related to the diagnosis of coronary artery
              disease. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 The Authors. International

  abstract = {In this work, the edge-based smoothed finite element method
              (ES-FEM) is incorporated with the Bathe time integration scheme to
              solve the transient wave propagation problems. The edge-based
              gradient smoothing technique (GST) can properly soften the ``overly
              soft'' system matrices from the standard finite element approach;
              then, the spatial numerical dispersion error of the calculated
              solutions for wave problems can be significantly reduced. To
              effectively solve the transient wave propagation problems, the
              Bathe time integration scheme is employed to perform the involved
              time integration. Due to the appropriate ``numerical dissipation
              effects'' from the Bathe time integration method, the spurious
              oscillations in the relatively large wave numbers (high
              frequencies) can be effectively suppressed; then, the temporal
              numerical dispersion error in the calculated solutions can also be
              notably controlled. A number of supporting numerical examples are
              considered to examine the capabilities of the present approach. The
              numerical results show that ES-FEM works very well with the Bathe
              time integration technique, and much more numerical solutions can
              be reached for solving transient wave propagation problems compared
              to the standard FEM.},

              problem with the unknowns in the velocity field. The resulting

              in which the continuity between time intervals is weakly enforced

              wave equation can yield a dispersive representation of the
              non-dispersive wave propagation problem resulting in a phase speed
              that depends, not only upon the wavelength of the signal being
              propagated, but also upon the direction of propagation. In this
              work, the dependence of the dispersive errors on the wave
              propagation direction, mesh aspect ratio and wave number is
              investigated with the goal of understanding and hopefully reducing
              the phase and group errors associated with the two-dimensional
              bilinear finite element. An analysis of the dispersive effects
              associated with the consistent, row---sum lumped and higher-order
              mass matrices has led to a reduced-coupling `penta-diagonal' mass
              matrix that yields improved phase and group errors with respect to
              wavelength and propagation direction. The influence of row---sum
              lumping the finite element mass matrix is demonstrated to always
              introduce lagging phase and group error, while a linear combination
              of the lumped and consistent mass matrices, i.e. a higher-order
              mass matrix, is shown to improve the dispersion characteristics of
              both the reduced and full-integration element. Using a 2.5\% phase
              error metric, the higher-order mass matrix can reduce the mesh
              resolution requirements relative to the lumped mass matrix by
              nearly a factor of two in one dimension; a factor of 4 in two
              dimensions. Similarly, the reduced-coupling mass matrix can reduce
              the grid requirements by a factor of approximately four relative to
              the lumped mass matrix; a factor of 16 in two dimensions. Although
              the reduced-coupling mass matrix requires additional storage
              relative to the lumped mass, the factor of 16 reduction in grid
              requirements promises tremendous overall savings for computing a
              fixed wavelength spectrum, or alternatively for resolving shorter
              wavelengths with a fixed grid resolution.},

  abstract = {This paper begins with personal recollections of John H. Argyris.
              The geometrical spirit embodied in Argyris's work is revived in the
              sequel in applying the newly developed concept of isogeometric
              analysis to structural vibration problems. After reviewing some
              fundamentals of isogeometric analysis, application is made to
              several structural models, including rods, thin beams, membranes,
              and thin plates. Rotationless beam and plate models are utilized as
              well as three-dimensional solid models. The concept of k-refinement
              is explored and shown to produce more accurate and robust results
              than corresponding finite elements. Through the use of nonlinear
              parameterization, ``optical'' branches of frequency spectra are
              eliminated for k-refined meshes. Optical branches have been
              identified as contributors to Gibbs phenomena in wave propagation
              problems and the cause of rapid degradation of higher modes in
              p-method finite elements. A geometrically exact model of the NASA
              Aluminum Testbed Cylinder is constructed and frequencies and mode
              shapes are computed and shown to compare favorably with
              experimental results.},

              popular for the generation of synthetic seismograms. We present
              formulas for the grid dispersion and stability criteria for some
              popular finite-element methods (FEM) for wave propagation, namely,
              classical and spectral FEM. We develop an approach based on a
              generalized eigenvalue formulation to analyze the dispersive
              behavior of these FEMs for acoustic or elastic wave propagation
              that overcomes difficulties caused by irregular node spacing within
              the element and the use of high-order polynomials, as is the case
              for spectral FEM. Analysis reveals that for spectral FEM of order
              four or greater, dispersion is less than 0.2\% at four to five
              nodes per wavelength, and dispersion is not angle dependent. New
              results can be compared with grid-dispersion results of some
              classical finite-difference methods (FDM) used for acoustic or
              elastic wave propagation. Analysis reveals that FDM and classical
              FEM require a larger sampling ratio than a spectral FEM to obtain
              results with the same degree of accuracy. The staggered-grid FDM is
              an efficient scheme, but the dispersion is angle dependent with
              larger values along the grid axes. On the other hand, spectral FEM
              of order four or greater is isotropic with small dispersion, making
              it attractive for simulations with long propagation times.},

              method; the computational cost is approximately double per time
              step, but the larger time step partially compensates for this
              additional cost. Necessary, but not sufficient, stability
              conditions are given for the mentioned methods for orders up to 10
              in space and time. The stability conditions for IP-DGM are

  abstract = {A finite element method is proposed to solve a scalar singular
              diffusion problem. The method is constructed by adding to the

              studies by considering two-parameter stabilization for plane
              elastic waves. A promising definition of the stability parameters
              eliminates dispersion errors of both longitudinal and transverse
              waves, but leads to considerable deterioration of the polarization.
              An alternative definition that eliminates dispersion of
              longitudinal waves in two directions balances dispersion and
              polarization errors, and provides the best overall performance.},

              element method for simulation of elastic wave propagation. While
              these operators use the same quadrature nodes as does the original
              spectral element method, they are designed in order that their
              lower-order contributions to the numerical dispersion error cancel
              each other. As a result, the modified spectral element method
              yields two extra-orders of accuracy, and is comparable to the
              original method of one order higher. The theoretical results are
              confirmed by numerical dispersion analysis and examples of
              computation of waveforms using our operators. Replacing the
              ordinary operators by those proposed in this study could be a

  abstract = {It is well-known that one key issue of solving the Helmholtz
              equation using finite element method (FEM) is the accuracy
              deterioration in the solution with increasing wave number due to
              the ``numerical dispersion error''. Such a numerical dispersion
              error is essentially caused by the ``overly-stiff'' nature of the
              FEM model. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an
              edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM) for analyzing
              acoustic problems using linear triangular and tetrahedron elements
              that can be generated automatically, respectively, for complicated
              two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains. The discretized
              linear system equations for ES-FEM are established using the
              smoothed Galerkin weak form with smoothing domains associated with
              the edges of the triangles or surfaces of the tetrahedrons. The
              edge-based gradient smoothing operation provides proper softening
              effect, makes the ES-FEM model much softer than the
              ``overly-stiff'' FEM model and hence significantly reduces the
              numerical dispersion error. Numerical examples, including a 2D
              problem of acoustic pressure distribution in a vehicle passenger
              compartment and a 3D problem about the acoustic pressure
              distribution in an engine chamber, have been studied using the
              present ES-FEM. The results demonstrate that the ES-FEM possesses
              the following advantages compared with the standard FEM using the
              same meshes. First, ES-FEM achieves similar convergence rate but
              better accuracy especially at high frequency. Second, ES-FEM is
              less sensitive to the mesh distortion, meaning that the quality of
              mesh has less effect on the solution of ES-FEM. Third, it works
              well for triangular types of meshes, and thus for the problems with
              complicated geometry.},

  abstract = {The classical finite element method (FEM) fails to provide
              accurate results to the Helmholtz equation with large wave numbers
              due to the well-known ``pollution error'' caused by the numerical
              dispersion, i.e. the numerical wave number is always smaller than
              the exact one. This dispersion error is essentially rooted at the
              ``overly-stiff'' feature of the FEM model. In this paper, an alpha
              finite element method ({$\alpha$}-FEM) is then formulated for the
              acoustic problems by combining the ``smaller wave number'' model of
              FEM and the ``larger wave number'' model of NS-FEM through a
              scaling factor \$\$\{a{\textbackslash}in [0,1]\}\$\$. The

              model, and accurate solutions can be obtained by tuning the {$

              particular alpha with which the {$\alpha$}-FEM model can possess a
              very ``close-to-exact'' stiffness, which can effectively reduce the
              dispersion error leading to dispersion free solutions for acoustic
              problems. Theoretical and numerical studies shall demonstrate the
              excellent properties of the present {$\alpha$}-FEM.},

  abstract = {When solving the equations of structural dynamics using direct
              time integration methods, algorithmic damping is useful in
              controlling spurious high-frequency oscillations. Ideally, an
              algorithm should possess asymptotic annihilation of the
              high-frequency response, i.e., spurious oscillations in the high
              frequencies are eliminated after one time step. In this paper, a
              new class of asymptotic annihilation algorithms for structural
              dynamics is presented that possesses little numerical dissipation
              in the low-frequency regime. The algorithms are based upon using
              finite elements in time. The displacement and velocity fields are
              interpolated independently using time-discontinuous functions. The
              equations of motion, displacement-velocity compatibility and the
              time continuity of displacement and velocity are satisfied weakly.
              Asymptotic annihilation is achieved by choosing the displacement
              and velocity fields to be of equal order. Algorithms of any desired
              order of temporal accuracy can be obtained by appropriate choice of
              the finite element interpolations in time. An analysis of the
              proposed class of algorithms is given proving the asymptotic
              annihilation property and the spectral equivalence of the
              algorithms to the upper diagonal of the Pad{\'e} approximation

              time-integration methods. These techniques are based on the
              modified integration rule for the mass and stiffness matrices and
              on the averaged mass matrix approaches that lead to the numerical
              dispersion reduction for linear finite elements. The analytical
              study of numerical dispersion for the new techniques is carried out
              in the 1-D, 2-D and 3-D cases. The numerical study of the
              efficiency of the dispersion reduction techniques includes the
              two-stage time-integration approach with the filtering stage
              (developed in our previous papers) that quantifies and removes
              spurious high-frequency oscillations from numerical results. We
              have found that in contrast to the standard linear elements with
              explicit time-integration methods and the lumped mass matrix, the
              finite element techniques with reduced dispersion yield more
              accurate results at small time increments (smaller than the
              stability limit) in the 2-D and 3-D cases. The recommendations for
              the selection of the size of time increments are suggested. The new
              approaches with reduced dispersion can be easily implemented into
              existing finite element codes and lead to significant reduction in
              computation time at the same accuracy compared with the standard
              finite element formulations.},

              reduced dispersion for the space discretization as well as the
              explicit central-difference method for time integration. The
              analytical study of the numerical dispersion shows that the most
              accurate results can be obtained with the time increments close to
              the stability limit. However, even in this case and the use of the
              linear elements with reduced dispersion, mesh refinement leads to
              divergent numerical results for acoustic waves under a suddenly
              applied load. This is explained by large spurious high-frequency
              oscillations. For the quantification and the suppression of

              accurate convergent results at mesh refinement as well as
              significantly reduces the numerical anisotropy of solutions. We

              introduces dispersion errors to the numerical solution of stress
              wave propagation. Errors of phase and group velocities and the
              scatter of wave propagation are induced. When these propagating
              phenomena are modelled by the FEM, the speed of a single harmonic
              wave depends on its frequency. Parasitic effects do not exist in an
              `ideal' unbounded continuum. With higher order finite elements,
              there are optical modes in the spectrum resulting in spurious
              oscillations of stress and velocity distributions near the sharp
              wavefronts. In principle, the dispersion errors and the spurious
              oscillations cannot be removed from these solutions but can be
              suppressed to a certain extent. For reliable numerical solutions by
              the FEM, the dispersion errors should be analysed and determined.
              The dispersion properties of a plane square biquadratic serendipity
              finite element are examined and compared with a bilinear one.
              Dispersion analysis is carried out for the consistent and lumped
              mass matrices. A dispersive `improved' lumped mass matrix for
              biquadratic serendipity elements is proposed. The paper closes with

              Fourier analysis of the B-spline variant of Finite Element Method
              (FEM). Generally, numerical results of elastic wave propagation in
              solids obtained by FEM are polluted by dispersion and attenuation.
              It was shown for the higher-order B-spline based FEM, that the
              optical modes did not occur in the case of infinite domains, unlike
              the higher-order Lagrangian and Hermitian finite elements, and also
              the dispersion errors are smaller. The paper's main focus is on the
              wave propagation through B-spline multi-patch/segment
              discretization with the C0 connection of B-spline segments and,
              chiefly, to the determining of dispersion and attenuation
              dependences. The numerical approach employed leads to substantial
              minimization of dispersion errors. Furthermore, the errors decrease
              in line with the increasing order of the B-spline elements/segments
              , with the local refinement, and also by the particular choice of
              the positions of control points through the optimizing procedure.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present the spectral element method to simulate
              elastic-wave propagation in realistic geological structures
              involving complieated free-surface topography and material
              interfaces for two- and three-dimensional geometries. The spectral
              element method introduced here is a high-order variational method
              for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass
              matrix is diagonal by construction in this method, which
              drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient
              parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are
              introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical
              domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum
              conserving scheme that can be put into a classical
              explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term
              energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as
              well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions. The associated
              Courant condition behaves as {$\Delta$}tC \&lt; O (nel-1/ndN-2),
              with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N
              the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of
              approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate
              when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the
              method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to
              analytical solutions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems
              of Lamb and Garvin. The flexibility of the method is then
              illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models involving
              realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very
              accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction
              , and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated with the
              free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The
              method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the
              diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface
              topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground
              motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are
              shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a
              heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient
              implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will
              allow to perform real-time visualization and interactive physical
              investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seismic risk

              provides an innovative numerical approach to the calculation of
              synthetic seismograms in 3-D earth models. The method combines the
              flexibility of a finite element method with the accuracy of a
              spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of
              motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is
              adapted to the free surface and to the main internal
              discontinuities of the model. The wavefield on the elements is
              discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and
              integration over an element is accomplished based upon the
              Gauss--Lobatto--Legendre integration rule. This combination of
              discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix,
              which greatly simplifies the algorithm. We illustrate the great
              potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete
              wavenumber/reflectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and
              surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle
              point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very
              steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method
              against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium
              with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the

              is developed in this paper. The proposed composite s-sub-step

              directly self-starting property, eliminating any starting
              procedures and avoiding computing the initial acceleration vector.
              The other is identical effective stiffness matrices within each

              propagation. Its main advantages are its accuracy and efficiency.
              Much work has been done to study the accuracy of SEM in
              quadrilateral elements, but the accuracy of this method using
              triangular elements is not well understood. In practice triangular
              elements are preferable to handle irregular geometries, but this
              introduces additional difficulties when obtaining the interpolation
              polynomial and quadrature points. In this paper, we show how to
              circumvent the difficulties using SEM with triangular elements
              (TSEM), and analyze two different types of nodes (Fekete points and
              Cohen points). The Fekete points are determined by minimizing the
              interpolation errors inside the element, while Cohen nodes are
              obtained by optimizing the accuracy of the quadrature rule. Both
              nodes have been employed for simulation, but their accuracy has not
              been studied. Our goal is to analyze the grid dispersion of these
              two types of nodes by considering the `X' type triangular mesh. The
              analyses are based on the plane wave assumption by solving an
              eigenvalue problem. Our results indicate that, considering the same
              polynomial order, employing Cohen nodes requires more nodes per
              element but yields more accurate results compared to the Fekete
              points. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that higher order
              polynomials will improve the accuracy for both Fekete and Cohen
              nodes, which is the case for quadrilateral elements.},

              stable scheme frequently used without adjusting any parameter. In
              the first sub-step the trapezoidal rule is used and in the second

              scheme, the 3-point trapezoidal rule for the complete step with two
              Newmark parameters. The parameters can then be used to smoothly

              integration scheme, the {$\beta$}1/{$\beta$}2-Bathe method, which
              is simple in its formulation and showed remarkable accuracy in the
              solution of problems [1]. A particular strength of the method is
              that it can directly be used as a first-order or second-order
              scheme by a change of the values of {$\beta$}1 and {$\beta$}2.
              While good results are obtained with reasonable values of {$\beta$}
              1 and {$\beta$}2, for excellent accuracy better values of the
              parameters need to be chosen. We propose in this paper values of {$
              \beta$}1 and {$\beta$}2 for the first-order scheme, best used in
              wave propagation analyses, and separate values for the second-order
              scheme, best used in analyses of structural vibrations. In each
              case, one set of values of ({$\beta$}1,{$\beta$}2) is given and to
              possibly improve the results only one of the parameters needs to be
              changed, that is, {$\beta$}1 for wave propagations and {$\beta$}2
              for structural vibrations, making the scheme a one-parameter
              method. Another strength of the procedure is that physical damping
              can directly be included in the solution, the effect of which on
              the stability and accuracy of the solutions we analyze in the
              paper. The use of the solution scheme in nonlinear analysis is, as
              we show in the paper, a simple extension from linear analysis.
              Finally, we give various solutions using the explicit {$\beta$}1/{$

              the most popular implicit and explicit time-domain and
              frequency-domain techniques. In addition to versatility and ease of
              implementation, it is imperative that one choose the most cost
              effective solution technique for a fixed degree of accuracy. To be
              of value, a solution technique must be able to minimize (1)
              numerical attenuation or amplification, (2) polarization errors,
              (3) numerical anisotropy, (4) errors in phase and group velocities,

              comparable when solving the scalar wave equation and when solving
              the elastic wave equations with Poisson's ratio less than 0.3.
              Finite-elements are superior to finite-differences when modeling
              elastic media with Poisson's ratio between 0.3 and 0.45. For both

  abstract = {Numerical solutions of the scalar and elastic wave equations have
              greatly aided geophysicists in both forward modeling and migration
              of seismic wave fields in complicated geologic media, and they
              promise to be invaluable in solving the full inverse problem. This
              paper quantitatively compares finite-difference and finite-element
              solutions of the scalar and elastic hyperbolic wave equations for
              the most popular implicit and explicit time-domain and
              frequency-domain techniques. In addition to versatility and ease of
              implementation, it is imperative that one choose the most cost
              effective solution technique for a fixed degree of accuracy. To be
              of value, a solution technique must be able to minimize (1)
              numerical attenuation or amplification, (2) polarization errors,
              (3) numerical anisotropy, (4) errors in phase and group velocities,
              (5) extraneous numerical (parasitic) modes, (6) numerical
              diffraction and scattering, and (7) errors and transmission
              coefficients. This paper shows that in homogeneous media the
              explicit finite-element and finite-difference schemes are
              comparable when solving the scalar wave equation and when solving
              the elastic wave equations with Poisson's ratio less than 0.3.
              Finite-elements are superior to finite-differences when modeling
              elastic media with Poisson's ratio between 0.3 and 0.45. For both
              the scalar and elastic equations, the more costly implicit time
              integration schemes such as the Newmark scheme are inferior to the
              explicit central-differences scheme, since time steps surpassing

              and the solution does not, therefore, preserve the phase
              characteristics of the exact solution. Improvements on the Galerkin
              method, including Galerkin least-squares (GLS) methods, have been
              proposed. However, these approaches rely on a dispersion analysis
              of the underlying difference stencils in order to reduce error in
              the solution. In this paper we propose a multiscale finite element
              for the Helmholtz equation. The method employs a multiscale
              variational formulation which leads to a subgrid model in which
              subgrid scales are incorporated analytically through appropriate
              Green's functions. It is shown that entirely new and accurate
              methods emerge and that GLS methods can be obtained as special

  abstract = {There are many novel applications of space-time decoupled least
              squares and Galerkin formulations that simulate wave propagation
              through different types of media. Numerical simulation of stress
              wave propagation through viscoelastic medium is commonly carried
              out using the space-time decoupled Galerkin weak form in site
              response problem, etc. In a recent investigation into accuracy of
              this formulation in simulating elastic wave propagation, it was
              shown that the diffusive and dispersive errors are greatly reduced
              when space-time coupled least squares formulation is used instead
              in variational form. This paper investigates convergence
              characteristics of both formulations. To this end, two test cases,
              which are site response and impact models for viscoelastic medium,
              are employed, one dominated by dispersive and the other by
              diffusive numerical error. Convergence studies reveal that,
              compared to the commonly used space-time decoupled Galerkin and the
              coupled least squares formulation has much lower numerical errors,
              higher rates of convergence, and ability to take far larger time
              increments in the evolution process. In solving such models,
              coefficient matrices would require updating after each time step, a

              (ST/FEM) can be used for developing arbitrary high-order accurate
              and unconditionally stable time integration schemes for
              elastodynamics problems. The existing ST/FEMs can be classified as
              the single-field and two-field ST/FEM: in the former method, either
              displacement or velocity, is independent and discontinuous in time.
              In contrast, in the latter method, both displacement and velocity
              fields are independent and discontinuous in time. Both methods have
              third-order accuracy for linear interpolation in time, higher than
              typical time integration schemes used in semi-discretized. However,
              these methods currently lack a unified computational framework, so
              each method requires a separate implementation. Therefore, the main
              goal of the present study is to develop a generalized computational
              framework that can facilitate the derivation and implementation of
              the existing linear-in-time ST/FEMs in a unified manner. This
              framework is developed by realizing that existing methods differ
              through the treatments of displacement-velocity relationships,
              which can be unified through displacement functions. In addition,
              by employing this framework, a new ST/FEM, which is designated as
              LC v-ST/FEM, is derived from the linear combination of displacement
              functions of single-field and two-field ST/FEMs. LC v-ST/FEM
              contains a user-defined parameter \$\${\textbackslash}alpha {
              \textbackslash}in [0,1]\$\$, which can be used for controlling the
              high-frequency dissipation characteristics. From finite difference
              analysis and numerical solutions of benchmark problems, it is
              demonstrated that the proposed method is the third order accurate
              in time, unconditionally stable, and contains negligible numerical
              dispersion error for all \$\$0 {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}
              alpha {\textbackslash}le 1\$\$. Moreover, for \$\${\textbackslash}
              alpha {\textbackslash}ne 0\$\$, the method can attenuate the
              spurious high-frequency components from the velocity and
              displacement fields.},

              The elastic term in the Rayleigh damping introduces a
              multiplicative T1/2 growth in the constant but otherwise the error
              bound is consistent with that obtained by Johnson, with a constant
              that grows a priori with T1/2 and also with norms of the solution.
              Gronwall's inequality is not used and so we can expect that this

              toward quasi-static deformation problems with hypoelastic and
              neo-Hookean hyperelastic constitutive models. The Cauchy stress in
              the weak form of the linear momentum equation is explicitly

              integration of objective stress rates transferred in the arbitrary

              contains the space-time nodal velocity as the primary unknown. An
              iterative algorithm for solving the discretized system equation is
              implemented, whereby the nonlinearities induced by geometrical
              change in the computational domain as well as nonlinear

              the stress and the strain over the moving mesh of the deforming

              traditional linear nodal interpolation functions for low order

              For the purpose of improving the computation accuracy and reducing
              the numerical dispersion error, the polynomial bases and the
              trigonometric functions are utilized to form the enrichment
              functions. In addition, a simple and direct approach is introduced
              with the aim to tackle the possible linear dependence of the system
              equations. The numerical results show that the accuracy of the
              obtained numerical results can be markedly improved by the proposed
              method in comparison with the standard finite elements. What's more
              , it can be found that the calculated solutions from the proposed

              to monotonically converge to the exact solution in transient wave
              analysis. In consequence, it is possible to consistently increase
              the solution accuracy by directly decreasing temporal
              discretization step size. This valuable and important property
              enable the present approach to be particularly suitable to tackle

              , in which residuals in least-squares form are added to the
              standard Galerkin variational equation, is developed to solve the
              Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. An important feature of GLS
              methods is the introduction of a local mesh parameter that may be
              designed to provide accurate solutions with relatively coarse
              meshes. Previous work has accomplished this for the one-dimensional
              Helmholtz equation using dispersion analysis. In this paper, the
              selection of the GLS mesh parameter for two dimensions is
              considered, and leads to elements that exhibit improved phase
              accuracy. For any given direction of wave propagation, an optimal
              GLS mesh parameter is determined using two-dimensional Fourier
              analysis. In general problems, the direction of wave propagation
              will not be known a priori. In this case, an optimal GLS parameter

              boundary conditions (NRBC) for unbounded wave problems are

              equations coupled with the first-order temporal equations
              associated with auxiliary functions in the NRBC. Due to the local
              nature of wave propagation, the iterative strategy requires only a
              few iterations per time step to resolve the solution to high
              accuracy. Further cost savings are obtained by diagonalizing the
              mass and boundary damping matrices. In this case the algebraic
              structure decouples the diagonal block matrices giving rise to an
              explicit multi-corrector method. An h-adaptive space--time strategy

              compared to standard interpolation and projection. Numerical
              studies of transient radiation and scattering demonstrate the

              space, and continuous or discontinuous in time. In a first test run
              , all four methods are applied to a linear scalar
              advection-diffusion model problem. Then, the convergence properties
              of the time-discontinuous space-time finite element discretizations
              are studied in numerical experiments. Advection velocity and
              diffusion coefficient are varied, such that the parabolic case of
              pure diffusion (heat equation), as well as, the hyperbolic case of
              pure advection (transport equation) are included in the study. For
              each model parameter set, the L2{\textbackslash} L\_2 {

              how advection-dominated the test case is, on the choice of the
              specific discretization method, and on the time-(in)dependence and
              treatment of the boundary conditions. Additionally, the potential

  abstract = {The Newmark average acceleration method is non-dissipative and
              unconditionally stable, but its accuracy in transient analysis of
              wave propagation problems depends not only on the spatial
              discretization but also on the temporal discretization. It has been
              found that the effects of spatial and temporal discretization when
              considered separately as commonly done, are far from adequate for
              most transient analysis. A better criterion manipulating the
              interdependent relationship between mesh size and time-step
              magnitude is imperative to achieve sufficiently accurate results of
              analysis. In this paper, the accuracy of the Newmark method is
              investigated by considering the two basic sources of errors, namely
              , numerical amplitude dissipation and velocity dispersion. The
              effects of both spatial and temporal discretizations are
              considered. A new technique to describe the characteristics of
              various frequency spectra is established. A criterion for mesh
              design and the selection of time-step magnitude is also proposed
              based on the combined effects of the amplitude dissipation and
              velocity dispersion. The efficiency and effectiveness of the
              proposed criterion are demonstrated using two one-dimensional wave
              propagation problems. A two-dimensional application shows that this

  abstract = {The dispersion and dissipation properties of numerical methods are
              very important in wave simulations. In this paper, such properties
              are analyzed for Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods and
              Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin methods when solving the linear
              advection equation. With the standard analysis, the asymptotic
              formulations are derived analytically for the discrete dispersion
              relation in the limit of K=kh{$\rightarrow$}0 (k is the wavenumber
              and h is the meshsize) as a function of the CFL number, and the
              results are compared quantitatively between these two fully
              discrete numerical methods. For Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin
              methods, we further introduce an alternative approach which is
              advantageous in dispersion analysis when the methods are of
              arbitrary order of accuracy. Based on the analytical formulations
              of the dispersion and dissipation errors, we also investigate the
              role of the spatial and temporal discretizations in the dispersion
              analysis. Numerical experiments are presented to validate some of
              the theoretical findings. This work provides the first analysis for
              Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin methods.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on increasing the accuracy of low-order
              (four-node quadrilateral) finite elements for the transient
              analysis of wave propagation. Modified integration rules,
              originally proposed for time-harmonic problems, provide the basis
              for the proposed technique. The modified integration rules shift
              the integration points to locations away from the conventional
              Gauss or Gauss-Lobatto integration points with the goal of reducing
              the discretization errors, specifically the dispersion error.
              Presented here is an extension of the idea to time-dependent
              analysis using implicit as well as explicit time-stepping schemes.
              The locations of the stiffness integration points remain unchanged
              from those in time-harmonic case. On the other hand, the locations
              of the integration points for the mass matrix depend on the
              time-stepping scheme and the step size. Furthermore, the central
              difference method needs to be modified from its conventional form
              to facilitate fully explicit computation. The superior performance
              of the proposed algorithms is illustrated with the help of several
              numerical examples.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive study of the two sub-steps composite implicit time
              integration scheme for the structural dynamics is presented in this
              paper. A framework is proposed for the convergence accuracy
              analysis of the generalized composite scheme. The local truncation
              errors of the acceleration, velocity, and displacement are
              evaluated in a rigorous procedure. The presented and proved
              accuracy condition enables the displacement, velocity, and
              acceleration achieving second-order accuracy simultaneously, which
              avoids the drawback that the acceleration accuracy may not reach
              second order. The different influences of numerical frequencies and
              time step on the accuracy of displacement, velocity, and
              acceleration are clarified. The numerical dissipation and
              dispersion and the initial magnitude errors are investigated
              physically, which measure the errors from the algorithmic
              amplification matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively.
              The load and physically undamped/damped cases are naturally
              accounted. An optimal algorithm-Bathe composite method (Bathe and
              Baig, 2005; Bathe, 2007; Bathe and Noh, 2012) is revealed with
              unconditional stability, no overshooting in displacement, velocity,
              and acceleration, and excellent performance compared with many
              other algorithms. The proposed framework also can be used for
              accuracy analysis and design of other multi-sub-steps composite
              schemes and single-step methods under physical damping and/or
              loading. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              iterative solver accelerated by a novel and efficient
              preconditioner. This preconditioner is constructed based on the
              block structure of coupled space--time system matrix, which is
              expressed as addition of Kronecker products of temporal and spatial
              submatrices. With this unique decomposition, the most
              computationally intensive operations in the iterative solver, i.e.
              matrix operations, are subsequently optimized and accelerated
              employing the inverse property of Kronecker product. Theoretical
              analysis and numerical examples both demonstrate that the proposed

              first-order equations is indicated and shows how some new, as well
